## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
* Submit a pull request to the original repository.
